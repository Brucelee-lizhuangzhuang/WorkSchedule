Work schedule：
Used to be:
except the Laboratory work

Every week:gym four times , and finish english reading：liuliyuedu, and punch util 100 days
english corner every Saturday night,but this year due to the classroom is occupied, there is no message about when it will begin



Need to make some changes, especially sleepling time
if everything is all right and the day is a normal not need to do anything else
  just sleep at 11 colok is the best.
else 
  prepare classes for the senior high student ,sleep before 12 clock 
Anyway , the earlier you sleep , the better you condition will be and the less winkle you face will have


More things need to learn:
1，Get a teacher qualification certificate
2，Learn to use tools like notepad++ and GitHub and jupyter notebook
3，Learn and understand C++ theory and figure out the platform based on virtual view rendering
4，Learn Python and do some deep learning projects (related to virtual viewt rendering)
5，Make a dataset about virtual view and use the GAN to fill the holes
